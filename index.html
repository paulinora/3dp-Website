		<h2>What is a 3d printer?</h2>
		
		<p>Well, a 3d printer a is a machine that takes code from a computer and
		converts it into a physically observable action. this code is called g-code.<br>
		The way you obtain this code is by taking a 3d model from a computer, 
		putting it into a slicer, which then takes that 3d model and converts it into<br>
		the code that the computer uses to move its motors, heat its hot end, and heat
		its build plate.
		</p>

		<h2>How does a 3d printer work?</h2>

		<p> There are many types of 3d printers that use different technologies to
		make a physical object. The most commonly known 3d printer is a FDM printer.<br>
		FDM stands for Fused Deposiition Modeling. This is the technology that
		takes a plastic and extrudes it into layers which build up a physical object.<br>
		</p>

		<h2>What are the parts of a 3d printer?</h2>

		<p>An FDM 3d printer has many parts that make it able to create a physical
		object. The Main parts are the Hotend, Extruder, Build Plate, and the circuit<br>
		board. The Extruder consists of a motor which pushes the filament to the 
		hotend, the drive gear and idler bearing which guide the filament to the hotend<br>
		, and the coupling and ptfe tube which connects the extruder to the hotend.
		The hotend is what melts the plastic from the extruder and lays it down in layers<br>
		in the y direction. The parts of a hot end are a nozzle which guides the filament to
		the build plate, The heat block which heats up the nozzle, The thermistor which heats  <br>
		the heat block, the thermistor that keeps track of the heat and maintains the set temp., 
		The heat sink that prevents the plastic from melting too high up in the hotend, <br>
		and the part cooling fan which cools the plastic as it is layed down. The build plate
		is what the object is printed on and moves in the y direction. The circuit board is<br>
		what takes the info from the computer and sends it to the thermistor, heat cartrige
		the motors and the build plate and fans. These parts work together to create final object<br>
